Scenario 1: Testing successful message posting

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulMessagePosting
  Description: This test is meant to check if a message is successfully posted to the forum chat by a user. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the required data including a valid message, userId and forumId. Mock the save method of the ChatRepository to simulate the saving of a message in the forum chat.
  Act: Invoke the newMessage method with the valid message, userId, and forumId.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned message is equal to the one passed to the method.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the message posting was successful and the returned message is equal to the one posted. This is significant as it validates the functionality of the message posting feature of the forum. 

Scenario 2: Testing message posting with empty message

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyMessagePosting
  Description: This test is meant to check what happens when an empty message is posted to the forum chat by a user. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the required data including an empty message, userId and forumId. Mock the save method of the ChatRepository to simulate the saving of a message in the forum chat.
  Act: Invoke the newMessage method with an empty message, userId, and forumId.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned message is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the returned message is empty when an empty message is posted. This is significant as it checks the system's behaviour against invalid input.

Scenario 3: Testing message posting with invalid userId

Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidUserIdMessagePosting
  Description: This test is meant to check what happens when a message is posted with an invalid userId.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the required data including a valid message, invalid userId and forumId. Mock the save method of the ChatRepository to simulate the saving of a message in the forum chat.
  Act: Invoke the newMessage method with a valid message, invalid userId, and forumId.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when a message is posted with an invalid userId. This is significant as it validates the system's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Testing message posting with invalid forumId

Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidForumIdMessagePosting
  Description: This test is meant to check what happens when a message is posted with an invalid forumId.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the required data including a valid message, userId and invalid forumId. Mock the save method of the ChatRepository to simulate the saving of a message in the forum chat.
  Act: Invoke the newMessage method with a valid message, userId, and invalid forumId.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when a message is posted with an invalid forumId. This is significant as it validates the system's error handling capabilities.

The test itself is not failing. The test executed successfully with no failures, errors, or skips as per the given logs. The problem is not with the business logic or the test case provided.

The error is happening during the report generation phase by the JaCoCo plugin, which is a code coverage tool. The error message "Unsupported class file major version 64" indicates that the JaCoCo plugin is not able to handle the class file version, probably because the Java version used to compile the classes is higher than the JaCoCo version can handle.

This issue can be resolved by updating the JaCoCo plugin to a version that supports the Java version used in the project or by reducing the Java version used in the project to a version supported by the current JaCoCo plugin version.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testSuccessfulMessagePosting() {
    when(chatRepository.save(any(ForumChatModel.class))).thenReturn(forumChatModel);

    assertEquals("Test message", message);
}

/*
The test itself seems to be running correctly, as the error logs show "Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0". The issue arises during the generation of the JaCoCo report, which is a tool used for measuring the code coverage of unit tests.

The error message "Unsupported class file major version 64" suggests that the version of JaCoCo being used is not compatible with the Java version used in the project. Java class file major version 64 corresponds to Java 16. It seems that the project has been compiled with Java 16, but the JaCoCo version (0.8.7) being used does not support this Java version. 

In order to fix the issue, you could either downgrade your Java version to a version compatible with JaCoCo 0.8.7, or upgrade JaCoCo to a version that supports Java 16 (if such a version is available).

@Tag("invalid")
public void testEmptyMessagePosting() {

The test `testInvalidUserIdMessagePosting` is failing because it's expecting a `ResponseStatusException` to be thrown when the `newMessage` method is called with an invalid userId (-1 in this case). However, no such exception is being thrown, which leads to the test failure.

Looking at the `newMessage` method, there's no validation being done on the userId. The method simply creates a new `ForumChatModel` with the provided parameters and saves it to the `ChatRepository`, regardless of whether the userId or forumId are valid or not.

Therefore, the test is failing because the business logic (in this case, the `newMessage` method) does not handle the scenario where the userId might be invalid. In other words, the test is correct in its expectation, but the method it's testing does not meet this expectation. 

To fix this issue, the `newMessage` method should be updated to validate the userId and throw a `ResponseStatusException` (or some other appropriate exception) when the userId is invalid. This would then align with the expectation set out in the test.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testInvalidUserIdMessagePosting() {
    assertThrows(ResponseStatusException.class, () -> forumController.newMessage("Test message", -1, 1));
}

/*
The test `testInvalidForumIdMessagePosting` is failing because it expects a `ResponseStatusException` to be thrown when the `newMessage` method of `forumController` is called with an invalid forum ID (-1 in this case). However, from the error logs, it's clear that no exception is thrown when the method is called with these parameters.

The `newMessage` method in the controller doesn't have any validation check for the forumId. If the forumId is invalid (negative in this case), the method should ideally throw a `ResponseStatusException`. But in its current implementation, it doesn't handle this case, and simply tries to save the message to the repository, regardless of whether the forumId is valid or not. 

As a result, when the test case is run, no exception is thrown, leading to a test failure. To fix this, you need to add validation logic in the `newMessage` method to check whether the forumId is valid before attempting to save the message to the repository. If the forumId is invalid, the method should throw a `ResponseStatusException`.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testInvalidForumIdMessagePosting() {
    assertThrows(ResponseStatusException.class, () -> forumController.newMessage("Test message", 1, -1));
