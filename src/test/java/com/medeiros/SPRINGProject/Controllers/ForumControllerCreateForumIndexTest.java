ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=createForumIndex_617623f3d0

Scenario 1: Test to check if a new forum is created successfully.

Details:
  TestName: createNewForumSuccessCase
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createForumIndex method successfully creates a new forum with the given parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ForumIndexRepo.save method to return a ForumIndexModel instance when called with the appropriate parameters. 
  Act: Invoke the createForumIndex method with a valid nameForum, forumDescription, and userId.
  Assert: Compare the returned string with "Forum criado".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the forum is created successfully and returns the expected confirmation message. This is significant for the application's functionality of creating new forums.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the correct exception is thrown when the forum name is null.

Details:
  TestName: createForumIndexNullNameCase
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createForumIndex method throws an exception when the nameForum parameter is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the createForumIndex method with a null nameForum, a valid forumDescription, and userId.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the correct exception is thrown when the forum name is null. This is important for validating user input and managing application errors.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the correct exception is thrown when the forum description is null.

Details:
  TestName: createForumIndexNullDescriptionCase
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createForumIndex method throws an exception when the forumDescription parameter is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the createForumIndex method with a valid nameForum, a null forumDescription, and userId.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the correct exception is thrown when the forum description is null. This is important for validating user input and managing application errors.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the correct exception is thrown when the userId is invalid.

Details:
  TestName: createForumIndexInvalidUserIdCase
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createForumIndex method throws an exception when the userId parameter is invalid. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the createForumIndex method with a valid nameForum, a valid forumDescription, and an invalid userId.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the correct exception is thrown when the userId is invalid. This is important for validating user input and managing application errors.

The problem arises during the JaCoCo report generation phase, as indicated by the log line:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project SPRINGProject: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation.

The specific error is "Unsupported class file major version 64". This indicates that the version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) that the JaCoCo tooling is using is older than the version of the JDK used to compile the classes under test.

In order to fix this issue, you should ensure that the version of the JDK used by JaCoCo is the same as or newer than the version used to compile the classes. This could involve either upgrading the JDK used by your build system or downgrading the JDK used to compile your classes.

The test `createForumIndexNullNameCase` is failing because it expects an exception to be thrown when the `nameForum` parameter is `null`. However, the `createForumIndex` method in the `ForumController` class does not check if the `nameForum` parameter is `null` before it is used to create a new `ForumIndexModel` object.

This means that when the `nameForum` parameter is `null`, no exception is thrown, and the test fails because it is expecting an exception. To fix this issue, there should be a null check in the `createForumIndex` method, and an exception should be thrown if the `nameForum` parameter is `null`. 

Additionally, it is important to note that the type of exception that the test is expecting is very generic (`Exception.class`). It would be better to expect a more specific exception, like `IllegalArgumentException`, to ensure that the test is not passing due to unrelated exceptions. 

In conclusion, the test is failing because the method under test does not throw an exception when the `nameForum` parameter is `null`, but the test expects an exception to be thrown in this case.

Based on the provided logs, the test `createForumIndexNullDescriptionCase` is failing because it's expecting an Exception to be thrown, but no exception is thrown when the test is executed. The specific error message is "Expected java.lang.Exception to be thrown, but nothing was thrown".

This indicates that the `createForumIndex` method in `ForumController` class does not throw an exception when a null `forumDescription` is passed as an argument. The business logic does not handle this case and does not throw an exception when the `forumDescription` is null. 

Therefore, the test fails because it does not behave as expected when a null `forumDescription` is provided. If the business logic should not accept a null `forumDescription`, then the method `createForumIndex` should be updated to throw an exception in this scenario. If the business logic can accept a null `forumDescription`, then the test case should be updated to reflect this.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void createForumIndexNullDescriptionCase() {
    String nameForum = "Test Forum";
    String forumDescription = null;
    int userId = 1;
    assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> {
        forumController.createForumIndex(nameForum, forumDescription, userId);
    });
}

The test case "createForumIndexInvalidUserIdCase" is failing because it's expecting an Exception to be thrown when userId is -1. The test case is designed to pass only if an Exception is thrown, but no exception is being thrown when the test is run, hence it fails. 

This indicates that the "createForumIndex" method in the controller doesn't have a check for invalid userId (like negative values) and it's not throwing an exception when such a case occurs. The business logic should ideally handle this scenario where the userId is invalid and throw an appropriate exception. 

In the context of this test case, a valid fix would be to include a check in the "createForumIndex" method for invalid userId and throw an exception when encountered. This will cause the test to pass as it's expecting an Exception when userId is -1. 

Please note that this change should be done with caution as it might affect other parts of the application that are using this method. It's always a good practice to handle such edge cases in the service layer rather than the controller layer.
