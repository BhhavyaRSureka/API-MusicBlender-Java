**Scenario 1: Valid ID Provided**
Details:
TestName: deleteUserWithValidId
Description: Tests if the deleteUserById method successfully deletes a user when a valid ID is provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Mock the UserAccRepo to simulate the deleteById method for a valid integer ID.
Act: Call deleteUserById with a valid ID string.
Assert: Verify that UserAccRepo.deleteById was called with the correct integer ID.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the delete operation was called with the exact ID converted from the string, validating that the system processes valid IDs correctly. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the deletion process in the application.
**Scenario 2: ID is Not a Number**
Details:
TestName: deleteUserWithNonNumericId
Description: Tests the deleteUserById method's response when a non-numeric string is passed as an ID.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangement since the parsing will fail.
Act: Call deleteUserById with a non-numeric ID string.
Assert: Expect an exception (NumberFormatException) to be thrown.
Validation:
This test validates that the method handles erroneous input gracefully by throwing an appropriate exception, ensuring the application's robustness against bad input data.
**Scenario 3: ID is Null**
Details:
TestName: deleteUserWithNullId
Description: Tests how deleteUserById behaves when null is passed as the ID.
Execution:
Arrange: No specific arrangement since the parsing will fail.
Act: Call deleteUserById with a null value.
Assert: Expect an exception (NumberFormatException) to be thrown.
Validation:
This test checks the method's resilience against null values, which could be a common erroneous case, ensuring that the application does not break unexpectedly.
**Scenario 4: Repository Throws Exception**
Details:
TestName: deleteUserWhenRepositoryThrowsException
Description: Tests the deleteUserById method's behavior if the UserAccRepo throws an exception during the deletion process.
Execution:
Arrange: Mock the UserAccRepo to throw a RuntimeException when deleteById is called.
Act: Call deleteUserById with a valid numeric ID string.
Assert: Expect a RuntimeException to be thrown.
Validation:
This test ensures that the method propagates exceptions thrown by the repository, which might indicate underlying issues with the database or the repository layer. It helps in understanding the error handling capability of the application.
**Scenario 5: Successful Deletion Confirmation**
Details:
TestName: confirmDeletionMessageOnSuccessfulDelete
Description: Tests whether the deleteUserById method returns the correct confirmation message upon successful deletion.
Execution:
Arrange: Mock the UserAccRepo to successfully execute deleteById without throwing any exceptions.
Act: Call deleteUserById with a valid numeric ID string.
Assert: Check that the return value is "Conta Deletada".
Validation:
This test checks that the user receives the correct feedback when a deletion is successfully performed, which is crucial for good user experience and confirms that the deletion process completes as expected.
