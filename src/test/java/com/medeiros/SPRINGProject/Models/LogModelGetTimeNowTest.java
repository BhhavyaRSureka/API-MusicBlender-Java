**Scenario 1: Verify Current Time Retrieval**
Details:
  TestName: verifyCurrentTimeRetrieval
  Description: This test verifies that the getTimeNow method correctly retrieves the current LocalDateTime. It ensures that the method is returning a time value that matches closely with the system's current time when the method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the method does not depend on any external inputs or states.
  Act: Call the getTimeNow method to retrieve the current time.
  Assert: Assert that the returned LocalDateTime is not null and is within a reasonable threshold (e.g., a few seconds) of LocalDateTime.now() at the time of method execution.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that getTimeNow provides a non-null result and the time it returns is current, reflecting the system's clock accurately. This is crucial to ensure that any functionality relying on this method receives an accurate timestamp for logging or other time-sensitive operations.
**Scenario 2: Verify Method Independence from Class Variables**
Details:
  TestName: verifyMethodIndependenceFromClassVariables
  Description: This test checks whether the getTimeNow method's output is independent of the private variables (logId, comando, classe, data) within the class. This ensures that the method's functionality is isolated and does not unintentionally depend on the class's state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize or alter the values of logId, comando, classe, and data.
  Act: Call the getTimeNow method after the class variables have been set.
  Assert: Verify that the output of getTimeNow remains consistent (within a reasonable time threshold) regardless of the class variable states.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getTimeNow method's functionality is purely to fetch the current time and is not affected by the state of other variables in the class. Ensuring method independence is crucial for maintaining clean, modular, and predictable code.
**Scenario 3: Concurrency Test for Time Retrieval**
Details:
  TestName: concurrencyTestForTimeRetrieval
  Description: This test evaluates the behavior of the getTimeNow method when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. It ensures that concurrent calls to the method do not lead to any unexpected behavior or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads that will call the getTimeNow method simultaneously.
  Act: Start all threads and let them invoke the getTimeNow method.
  Assert: Ensure that all threads successfully execute the method and that the time values they retrieve are logical (i.e., not significantly different from one another and reflect the current time during execution).
Validation:
  This test checks the thread safety of the getTimeNow method, ensuring that it can handle concurrent access without failure or incorrect time reporting. This is crucial in multi-threaded environments where the method might be called by different parts of an application simultaneously.
These scenarios comprehensively test the getTimeNow method for accuracy, independence, and concurrency, ensuring robust and reliable functionality in various operational contexts.
