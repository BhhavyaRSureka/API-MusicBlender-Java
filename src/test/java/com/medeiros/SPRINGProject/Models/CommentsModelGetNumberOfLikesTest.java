```markdown
Scenario 1: Validate Initial State of NumberOfLikes
Details:
  TestName: checkInitialNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks the initial state of NumberOfLikes when no likes have been recorded yet. It is important to ensure that the default behavior of the getter method is correct when no data has been manipulated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the getNumberOfLikes method without setting NumberOfLikes.
  Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the default value of NumberOfLikes is 0, assuming it has not been set yet. This is crucial for understanding the initial state of a new object in the application.
Scenario 2: Validate Positive NumberOfLikes
Details:
  TestName: checkPositiveNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test verifies that the getNumberOfLikes method correctly returns a positive integer when the NumberOfLikes has been previously set to a positive value. It ensures that the getter behaves correctly under normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set NumberOfLikes to a positive value (e.g., 150).
  Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the same positive value (150).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getNumberOfLikes method correctly retrieves the value of NumberOfLikes when it is set to a typical positive number. This test is important to confirm that the method handles standard use cases correctly.
Scenario 3: Validate NumberOfLikes Unchanged After Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: checkNumberOfLikesUnchangedAfterMultipleCalls
  Description: This test ensures that the getNumberOfLikes method returns a consistent result across multiple calls without any state changes in between. This scenario tests the immutability of the value once set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set NumberOfLikes to any arbitrary positive number (e.g., 75).
  Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all results are consistently 75.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for consistency in the returned value across multiple invocations. This is significant for ensuring that the getter method does not inadvertently modify the underlying data.
Scenario 4: Validate NumberOfLikes with Maximum Integer Value
Details:
  TestName: checkNumberOfLikesWithMaxIntegerValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getNumberOfLikes method when the number of likes is set to the maximum value for an integer. This scenario tests the system's ability to handle extreme cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set NumberOfLikes to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Call the getNumberOfLikes method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getNumberOfLikes method can handle the largest possible integer value, which is critical for ensuring the robustness of the application against extreme values.
```
These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring that the method behaves correctly under various conditions.
