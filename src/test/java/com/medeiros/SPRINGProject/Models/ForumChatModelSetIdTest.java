Scenario 1: Set a valid positive integer ID
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithPositiveInteger
  Description: This test checks if the setId method correctly sets a positive integer value to the private field 'id'.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created.
  Act: The setId method is invoked with a positive integer, such as 123.
  Assert: Assert that the 'id' field of the instance is now set to 123.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the 'id' field is correctly assigned the positive integer value. This is crucial for ensuring the object can be correctly identified by its ID in operations such as database transactions, given the jakarta.persistence import which suggests database interaction.
Scenario 2: Set a negative integer ID
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeInteger
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setId method when passed a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created.
  Act: The setId method is invoked with a negative integer, such as -1.
  Assert: Assert that the 'id' field of the instance is now set to -1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the 'id' field can handle and store negative values, which might be significant if the system uses negative IDs for special cases or error handling.
Scenario 3: Set ID to zero
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithZero
  Description: This test verifies the setId method's ability to handle and set an ID of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created.
  Act: The setId method is invoked with 0.
  Assert: Assert that the 'id' field of the class instance is set to 0.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that zero, a boundary value, is correctly handled by the setId method. This is important as zero might be used as a default or uninitialized value in some systems.
Scenario 4: Effect of setting ID on other private fields
Details:
  TestName: setIdCheckOtherFieldsUnchanged
  Description: This test ensures that setting the ID does not inadvertently alter any other private fields in the class.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created with initial values for 'message', 'userId', and 'forumId'.
  Act: The setId method is invoked with a value, such as 100.
  Assert: Assert that the values of 'message', 'userId', and 'forumId' remain unchanged.
Validation:
  This test checks the isolation of the setId method, ensuring it does not have side effects on other fields. Maintaining field independence is crucial for avoiding bugs in the system where unrelated data might get altered inadvertently.
Scenario 5: Repeated calls to setId
Details:
  TestName: setIdWithRepeatedCalls
  Description: This test checks if repeated calls to setId with different values correctly update the 'id' field each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of the class is created.
  Act: The setId method is invoked sequentially with different values, such as 200 then 300.
  Assert: Assert that the 'id' field of the instance is set to 300 after the second call.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the setId method updates the 'id' field each time it is called, reflecting the most recent value passed. This behavior is crucial for scenarios where the object's ID might need to be updated during its lifecycle.
