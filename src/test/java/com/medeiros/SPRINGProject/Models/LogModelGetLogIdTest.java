Scenario 1: Default logId Value Test
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultLogIdValue
  Description: This test verifies that the default value of logId is properly handled when the method getLogId is called. Since logId is a private integer field initialized to null and managed by JPA with @Id and @GeneratedValue, it should handle uninitialized states correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the getLogId method without setting the logId explicitly.
  Act: Invoke the getLogId method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the default initialization of an int type, which should be 0.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for the default integer value because uninitialized int fields in Java default to 0. This is crucial to ensure that the entity handles uninitialized states without errors, especially before persistence operations occur.
Scenario 2: Persisted logId Value Test
Details:
  TestName: testPersistedLogIdValue
  Description: This test checks that the getLogId method returns the correct logId after the entity has been persisted and the logId has been set by the JPA @GeneratedValue strategy.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate the persisting of the entity using a mock EntityManager to set the logId to a specific non-zero value.
  Act: Retrieve the logId using the getLogId method after the entity is assumed to be persisted.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved logId matches the expected value set by the EntityManager during persistence.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the correct functionality of the @GeneratedValue annotation and ensures that the logId is being set correctly upon persistence. This test is vital for confirming that the identifier generation strategy is integrated correctly with the entity lifecycle.
Scenario 3: Concurrency in logId Access
Details:
  TestName: testLogIdAccessUnderConcurrency
  Description: This test aims to ensure that concurrent access to the getLogId method does not result in inconsistent reads or race conditions, given that logId is a shared resource in a multi-threaded environment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up multiple threads to access the getLogId method simultaneously after setting a predefined logId.
  Act: Each thread calls the getLogId method.
  Assert: Check that all threads receive the same logId value and that no errors or data races occur during access.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for consistent results across all threads, emphasizing the importance of thread safety in the application. This ensures that the logId can be reliably accessed in a concurrent environment, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency in multi-threaded or high-load scenarios.
