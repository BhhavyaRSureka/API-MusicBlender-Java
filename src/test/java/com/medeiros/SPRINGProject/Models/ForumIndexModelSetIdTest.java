Scenario 1: Set a valid integer ID
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithValidInteger
  Description: This test verifies whether the setId method correctly sets an integer ID. This is to ensure that the ID field is updated with a valid integer as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setId method.
  Act: Call setId with a valid integer, e.g., 123.
  Assert: Assert that the id field of the instance is updated to 123.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test checks if the private field 'id' is correctly set by the setId method, which is crucial for correctly identifying objects in business logic and database operations.
Scenario 2: Set ID with zero
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithZero
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setId method when zero is passed as an argument. It's important to verify how the system handles boundary values like zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setId method.
  Act: Call setId with 0.
  Assert: Assert that the id field of the instance is updated to 0.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that setting an ID to zero does not cause errors or unexpected behavior, ensuring robustness in handling edge cases.
Scenario 3: Set ID with a negative number
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeNumber
  Description: This test examines the setId method's response to negative integers. Handling negative values is essential for ensuring the robustness of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setId method.
  Act: Call setId with a negative integer, e.g., -1.
  Assert: Assert that the id field of the instance is updated to -1.
Validation: 
  This test checks the method's ability to handle negative values, which might be critical if negative IDs have a special meaning or should be handled differently in the application.
Scenario 4: Set ID and check persistence
Details:  
  TestName: setIdAndCheckPersistence
  Description: This test aims to verify if the ID set by setId is correctly managed by the persistence layer, assuming the class is an entity managed by Jakarta Persistence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the persistence context and create an instance of the class.
  Act: Set an ID and simulate the persistence operation.
  Assert: Verify that the persistence context correctly receives and stores the new ID.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the ID changes are correctly managed by the persistence layer, which is vital for database consistency and the integrity of transactions within the application.
Scenario 5: Set ID and verify related object update
Details:  
  TestName: setIdAndVerifyRelatedUpdate
  Description: Test the setId method to ensure that related objects or fields (if any exist) are updated or invalidated appropriately when the ID is changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and any related objects or fields that should be affected by an ID change.
  Act: Change the ID using setId and check any side effects on related objects.
  Assert: Assert that related objects or states reflect the change appropriately.
Validation: 
  This scenario checks for the consistency and integrity of object relationships within the application when primary identifiers are altered. This is essential for maintaining correct application state and behavior.
