Scenario 1: Basic functionality test
Details:
  TestName: testBasicFunctionality
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the value of the private field NumberOfComments when called. This is to ensure that the basic getter functionality is working as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a class instance and set the NumberOfComments field value manually or via a constructor if available.
  Act: Invoke the getNumberOfComments method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the manually set NumberOfComments field value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test verifies that the getter method correctly accesses and returns the current state of the NumberOfComments field. It's significant as it confirms the method's capability to read class state accurately, which is crucial for any operations or calculations depending on the number of comments.
Scenario 2: Test with unmodified NumberOfComments
Details:
  TestName: testUnmodifiedNumberOfComments
  Description: Checks the behavior of getNumberOfComments when the NumberOfComments has not been explicitly set. This scenario tests the default initialization state of the NumberOfComments field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without modifying the NumberOfComments field.
  Act: Call getNumberOfComments method.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals the default value of an int in Java, which is 0.
Validation:
  The test checks that the uninitialized state of NumberOfComments behaves as expected, returning the default int value. This is important as it validates the class's behavior under default conditions, ensuring that there are no unintended initial values.
Scenario 3: Test with maximum integer value
Details:
  TestName: testMaxIntegerValueOfComments
  Description: Evaluates the method's ability to handle and return the maximum possible integer value, testing the upper boundary of the field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set NumberOfComments to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Invoke getNumberOfComments.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getNumberOfComments method can handle large values and correctly returns them, which is crucial for data integrity and correctness, especially under extreme conditions.
Scenario 4: Test after modifying NumberOfComments multiple times
Details:
  TestName: testMultipleModifications
  Description: Checks if the getNumberOfComments method consistently returns the latest value of NumberOfComments after multiple modifications.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance and modify the NumberOfComments field several times.
  Act: Call getNumberOfComments after the final modification.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the last set value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getNumberOfComments method accurately reflects the most current state of the NumberOfComments field even after several changes. It's essential for ensuring the method's reliability and responsiveness to state changes within the class.
