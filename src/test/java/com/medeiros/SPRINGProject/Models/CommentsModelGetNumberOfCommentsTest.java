Scenario 1: Basic functionality test
Details:
  TestName: testBasicFunctionality
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly returns the value of the private field NumberOfComments when called. This is to ensure that the basic getter functionality is working as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a class instance and set the NumberOfComments field value manually or via a constructor if available.
  Act: Invoke the getNumberOfComments method on the instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the manually set NumberOfComments field value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test verifies that the getter method properly accesses the private field and returns its value, which is crucial for displaying the number of comments in the application's UI.
Scenario 2: Default value test
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getNumberOfComments method returns a default value (assuming default is 0 if not set) when the NumberOfComments field has not been initialized explicitly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the NumberOfComments field.
  Act: Call the getNumberOfComments method on the new instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 0 using JUnit assertions.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getter method handles uninitialized values correctly, returning a default of 0, which is essential for new instances where comments have not yet been added.
Scenario 3: Concurrent access test
Details:
  TestName: testConcurrentAccess
  Description: This test checks if the getNumberOfComments method can handle concurrent calls without returning inconsistent values, ensuring thread safety.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a class instance with a specific NumberOfComments value. Use multiple threads to call the getNumberOfComments method simultaneously.
  Act: Execute all threads and collect the results.
  Assert: Verify that all threads return the same NumberOfComments value using JUnit assertions.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method is thread-safe and returns consistent results when accessed by multiple threads, which is critical for a web application where multiple users might query the number of comments concurrently.
Scenario 4: Negative value test
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getNumberOfComments method when the NumberOfComments field is set to a negative value, which might indicate a logical error elsewhere in the application.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the NumberOfComments to a negative value.
  Act: Call the getNumberOfComments method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns the negative value.
Validation:
  This test checks that the getter method accurately reflects the field's value, even if it's negative, highlighting potential issues in the application's logic where the number of comments should logically always be non-negative.
These scenarios provide a comprehensive test suite that covers various aspects of the getNumberOfComments method's functionality and its robustness in different situations.
