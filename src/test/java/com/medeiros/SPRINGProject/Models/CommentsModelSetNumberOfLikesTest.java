### Test Scenarios for `setNumberOfLikes` Method
**Scenario 1: Valid Positive Number of Likes**
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks whether the method correctly sets a positive number of likes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the `setNumberOfLikes` method.
  Act: Call `setNumberOfLikes` with a positive integer, e.g., 150.
  Assert: Verify that the `NumberOfLikes` field is set to 150.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the `NumberOfLikes` field correctly reflects the input value. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of setting a positive number of likes, which is a common operation.
**Scenario 2: Zero Number of Likes**
Details:
  TestName: setZeroNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test verifies if the method can correctly handle and set the number of likes to zero, which is a boundary condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call `setNumberOfLikes` with 0.
  Assert: Verify that the `NumberOfLikes` field is set to 0.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that setting zero likes, a valid and possible scenario, is handled correctly. This is important for cases where a new or unpopular content item might not have any likes yet.
**Scenario 3: Negative Number of Likes**
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a negative input, which might be considered an invalid scenario in business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call `setNumberOfLikes` with a negative integer, e.g., -10.
  Assert: Verify that the `NumberOfLikes` field is set to -10 (if the method does not have validation against negative numbers).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the field holds the negative value, which might indicate a lack of validation in the method. This test is crucial for identifying potential data integrity issues in the application.
**Scenario 4: Large Number of Likes**
Details:
  TestName: setLargeNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test ensures that the method can handle and correctly set very large numbers, testing the upper limits of integer handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call `setNumberOfLikes` with a large positive integer, e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Verify that the `NumberOfLikes` field is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method can handle the maximum possible integer value, which is important for ensuring the robustness of the application under extreme conditions.
**Scenario 5: Reset Number of Likes**
Details:
  TestName: resetNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks whether the number of likes can be reset to a different positive number after being initially set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and initially set likes to 100.
  Act: Call `setNumberOfLikes` again with a different positive number, e.g., 50.
  Assert: Verify that the `NumberOfLikes` field is updated to 50.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that updating the number of likes is handled correctly, which is essential for dynamic content whose popularity can change over time.
