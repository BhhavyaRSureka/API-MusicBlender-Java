Scenario 1: Normal behavior test for getId
Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly returns the value of the private field 'id'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the object of the class containing the getId method and set the 'id' field to a known value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the initialized object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the known value set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getId method properly accesses and returns the current value of the 'id' field. This test is significant as it ensures that the method correctly handles access to private class fields and returns accurate data, which is critical for any operations or logic depending on the ID of the object.
Scenario 2: Default value test for getId
Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsDefaultValue
  Description: Tests if the getId method returns the default value for the 'id' field when it has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the 'id' field.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on this new instance.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 0, which is the default value for an uninitialized int in Java.
Validation:
  This test validates that getId handles uninitialized fields correctly, returning the default int value. This is important for understanding the behavior of the class when working with new or reset instances, ensuring that the system handles such cases without errors or unexpected behavior.
Scenario 3: Consistency test for multiple calls to getId
Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsConsistentValue
  Description: Ensures that repeated calls to getId return the same value, confirming the method's consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the 'id' to a specific value.
  Act: Call getId multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same value.
Validation:
  This test checks the consistency of the getId method over multiple invocations. It is crucial for ensuring that the method does not alter the state of the object or produce different results under the same conditions, which is vital for reliability in multi-step processes or multi-threaded environments.
Scenario 4: Thread-safety test for getId
Details:
  TestName: getIdThreadSafetyCheck
  Description: Verifies that getId returns consistent results when accessed by multiple threads, ensuring thread safety.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a set 'id', and access getId from multiple threads simultaneously.
  Act: Each thread calls getId, and their outputs are recorded.
  Assert: Confirm that all threads receive the same 'id' value.
Validation:
  This test is essential for confirming that getId is thread-safe and behaves predictably under concurrent access. This is particularly important in a multi-threaded application environment to prevent data corruption or inconsistent data access.
These scenarios cover a range of standard and edge cases for the getId method, ensuring comprehensive testing of both typical usage and potential exceptional conditions.
