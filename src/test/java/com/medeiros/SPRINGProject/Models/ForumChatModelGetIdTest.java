Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of ID when set to a default value
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWithDefaultValue
  Description: This test checks whether the getId method returns the default value of the 'id' field when it has not been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the getId method without setting the 'id'.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instantiated object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is the default for an uninitialized int (which should be 0).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the default Java behavior for uninitialized int fields is adhered to, ensuring that getId correctly reflects the state of the 'id' field. This is significant as it confirms the method's reliability in scenarios where the 'id' is not yet assigned.
Scenario 2: Correct retrieval of ID after setting a specific value
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdAfterSettingValue
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method correctly returns the value of the 'id' field after it has been set to a specific non-default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and set the 'id' to a specific value (e.g., 123).
  Act: Call the getId method on the instantiated object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the value set (123 in this case).
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that getId accurately retrieves the 'id' field's current value, which is crucial for the correct representation of object identity within the application.
Scenario 3: Concurrency test for ID retrieval
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdConcurrency
  Description: This test examines the thread-safety of the getId method by accessing it from multiple threads simultaneously.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class and set the 'id' to a known value. Create multiple threads that will fetch the 'id' simultaneously.
  Act: Start all threads and capture the output from the getId method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that all threads receive the same 'id' value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for consistent results across concurrent accesses, which is vital in a multi-threaded environment to prevent data inconsistency. This test is significant as it assures that getId can be safely used in concurrent scenarios, adhering to typical requirements in enterprise applications using Jakarta Persistence.
Scenario 4: Persistence annotation influence on ID retrieval
Details:
  TestName: testGetIdWithPersistenceContext
  Description: This test aims to verify if the getId method behaves as expected under a managed persistence context, assuming that the class might be an entity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock persistence context and associate the entity class. Set the 'id' to a specific value within this context.
  Act: Retrieve the 'id' through the getId method within the mock persistence context.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved 'id' is as set within the persistence context.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getId method functions correctly within a persistence context, which is crucial for applications relying on Jakarta Persistence for ORM capabilities. This test confirms that the entity's identity is maintained across persistence operations.
