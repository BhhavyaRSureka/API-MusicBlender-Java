Scenario 1: Verify getData returns null when data field is uninitialized
Details:
  TestName: getDataReturnsNullIfUninitialized
  Description: This test verifies that the getData method returns null if the LocalDateTime 'data' field in the class is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class without setting the 'data' field.
  Act: Call the getData method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that the method correctly handles the case where the 'data' field is null, which is its default state upon object instantiation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It's important to ensure that the method behaves as expected in scenarios where the date and time are not set to prevent errors in the application's logic that might rely on this value.
Scenario 2: Verify getData returns the correct LocalDateTime when data field is set
Details:
  TestName: getDataReturnsCorrectDateTimeIfSet
  Description: This test checks that the getData method returns the exact LocalDateTime value that was set for the 'data' field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class and set the 'data' field with a specific LocalDateTime value.
  Act: Call the getData method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned LocalDateTime matches the one set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the getData method correctly retrieves the value of the 'data' field without alteration.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validating that the method returns accurate data is crucial for the integrity of the application, especially when time-sensitive operations depend on this timestamp.
Scenario 3: Verify getData is thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads
Details:
  TestName: getDataIsThreadSafe
  Description: This test aims to verify that the getData method can be safely called from multiple threads simultaneously without causing inconsistent results or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a known LocalDateTime in the 'data' field. Create multiple threads that will call the getData method concurrently.
  Act: Start all threads and capture the results of the getData method.
  Assert: Assert that all threads received the same LocalDateTime value and that no exceptions were thrown.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks for the thread safety of the getData method, ensuring that concurrent accesses yield consistent results.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring thread safety is important in a multi-threaded environment to prevent data corruption and ensure reliable application behavior.
