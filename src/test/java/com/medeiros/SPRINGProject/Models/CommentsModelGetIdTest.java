Scenario 1: Valid Id Retrieval
Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsValidId
  Description: This test checks if the getId method correctly retrieves the id of the object when it is set to a valid integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id field to a known integer value.
  Act: Call the getId method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the integer set during arrangement.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that getId accurately retrieves the id value that was explicitly set, ensuring data integrity and correct behavior of the getter method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that the getId method functions correctly is crucial for any operations or logic that depend on the unique identifier of the object, such as database operations or entity relationships managed by JPA.
Scenario 2: Default Id Value
Details:
  TestName: getIdWithUninitializedId
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the getId method when the id has not been initialized and relies on default Java behavior for primitive types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without explicitly setting the id.
  Act: Call the getId method on the newly created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the default for int type, which is 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the default Java behavior for uninitialized int fields is upheld, which should return 0 for int types.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Confirming that an uninitialized id returns a default value is important to prevent unexpected behavior in parts of the application that assume the id has been deliberately set, particularly in scenarios involving database entities and JPA operations.
Scenario 3: Id Consistency After Multiple Accesses
Details:
  TestName: consistentIdReturnValue
  Description: This scenario tests that multiple calls to getId return the same value, assuming no alterations to the id in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id to a specific value.
  Act: Call getId multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test ensures that the getId method provides a consistent return value across multiple invocations without external modification of the id.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Consistency in returned values from getter methods is critical for stability and reliability in applications, particularly those involving repeated data retrieval for display or calculations.
