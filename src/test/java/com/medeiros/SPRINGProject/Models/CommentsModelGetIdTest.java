Scenario 1: Test to check the returned id is correct
Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getId method returns the correct id that was previously set using the setId method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CommentsModel object and set the id using the setId method.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the CommentsModel object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned id is the same as the one set earlier.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly retrieves the id of the CommentsModel object. The expected result is that the returned id matches the one that was set, as this ensures correct data retrieval.

Scenario 2: Test to check the id remains unchanged after other property modifications
Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdRemainsUnchangedAfterOtherPropertyModifications
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getId method still returns the correct id after other properties of the CommentsModel object have been modified.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a CommentsModel object, set the id, and then change other properties.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on the CommentsModel object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned id is the same as the one set earlier.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method's functionality is not affected by modifications to other properties of the CommentsModel object. The expected result is that the returned id matches the one that was set, ensuring that the getId method is functioning correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check the id of two different CommentsModel objects
Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdForTwoDifferentObjects
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getId method returns the correct id for two different CommentsModel objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different CommentsModel objects and set different ids for each.
    Act: Invoke the getId method on both CommentsModel objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ids match the ones that were set for each object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getId method correctly retrieves the id of each CommentsModel object. The expected result is that the returned ids match the ones that were set for each object, ensuring that the getId method is functioning correctly on multiple instances.
