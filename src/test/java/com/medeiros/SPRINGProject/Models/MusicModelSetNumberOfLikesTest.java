```
Scenario 1: Setting a positive number of likes
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks if the setNumberOfLikes method correctly assigns a positive integer value to the NumberOfLikes field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfLikes method.
  Act: Call setNumberOfLikes with a positive integer, for instance, 100.
  Assert: Assert that the NumberOfLikes field is updated to the value 100.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the NumberOfLikes field correctly stores positive integers, reflecting the expected behavior when a user likes a music track. This is significant as it directly impacts the user feedback visibility on the platform.
Scenario 2: Setting zero as the number of likes
Details:
  TestName: setZeroNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test verifies if the NumberOfLikes field can be set to zero, which might represent no likes or resetting the likes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfLikes method.
  Act: Call setNumberOfLikes with 0.
  Assert: Assert that the NumberOfLikes field is updated to 0.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the system can correctly represent scenarios where a music track has not received any likes, allowing for accurate data representation and user interface updates.
Scenario 3: Setting a negative number of likes
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeNumberOfLikes
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setNumberOfLikes method when passed a negative integer, which is generally not a valid scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfLikes method.
  Act: Call setNumberOfLikes with a negative integer, such as -1.
  Assert: Assert that the NumberOfLikes field is not updated or throws an error.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the system handles erroneous input gracefully by not allowing the number of likes to be set to a negative number. This is important to maintain data integrity and prevent potential misuse or errors in user interactions.
Scenario 4: Setting a large number of likes
Details:
  TestName: setLargeNumberOfLikes
  Description: Tests the system's ability to handle very large numbers, assessing performance and potential integer overflow issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setNumberOfLikes method.
  Act: Call setNumberOfLikes with a very large positive integer (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE).
  Assert: Assert that the NumberOfLikes field is updated to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the application in handling extreme values, ensuring that the system can perform under varying loads and data conditions without crashing or behaving unexpectedly.
