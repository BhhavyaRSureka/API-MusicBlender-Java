Scenario 1: Validate MusicID Default Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultMusicIDValue
  Description: This test verifies that the default value of MusicID is as expected when no value has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing getMusicID method.
  Act: Call the getMusicID method on the instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned MusicID is 0 (default uninitialized value for an int in Java).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks if the MusicID returns its default uninitialized value of int type, which should be 0.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that uninitialized int fields return default values is crucial for understanding object state at instantiation and for avoiding unexpected behaviors in dependent functionalities.
Scenario 2: Validate MusicID After Setting a Valid Value
Details:
  TestName: verifyMusicIDAfterSettingValidValue
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the getMusicID method after the MusicID has been set to a known value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and use reflection or a setter method (if available) to set the MusicID to a specific value, e.g., 123.
  Act: Call the getMusicID method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the value set (123 in this case).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that once the MusicID is set, it retains this value and returns it correctly when getMusicID is called.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates the integrity of setting and retrieving the MusicID, which is critical for correctly identifying music tracks in operations and logic that depend on unique identifiers.
Scenario 3: Validate MusicID Unchanged for Multiple Accesses
Details:
  TestName: verifyMusicIDUnchangedOnMultipleAccesses
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to getMusicID return the same value consistently when no changes are made to the MusicID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the MusicID to a specific value, e.g., 456.
  Act: Call getMusicID method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values from these calls are the same and equal to 456.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Validates the consistency and immutability of the MusicID value in the scope of multiple accesses.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the MusicID property is reliable and stable, which is essential for operations requiring frequent access to the music identifier without alteration.
