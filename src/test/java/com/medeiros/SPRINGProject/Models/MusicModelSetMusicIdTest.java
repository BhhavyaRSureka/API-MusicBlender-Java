``` 
Scenario 1: Setting a valid music ID
Details:
  TestName: setValidMusicId
  Description: This test checks whether the setMusicId method correctly assigns a valid integer to the MusicId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Music object and define a valid integer musicId.
  Act: Call setMusicId with the defined valid musicId.
  Assert: Assert that the MusicId field of the Music object is equal to the provided musicId.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensuring that the method properly sets the value of MusicId confirms that the setter method is functioning as intended.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Proper functioning of setter methods is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of data within the application.
Scenario 2: Setting a music ID with the minimum integer value
Details:
  TestName: setMusicIdWithMinValue
  Description: Verifies if the setMusicId method can handle and correctly assign the minimum possible integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Music object and use Integer.MIN_VALUE as the musicId.
  Act: Call setMusicId with Integer.MIN_VALUE.
  Assert: Assert that the MusicId field is set to Integer.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test ensures that the method can handle edge case values and correctly assign them to the MusicId field.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that boundary values are handled correctly prevents potential bugs and data integrity issues in the application.
Scenario 3: Setting a music ID with the maximum integer value
Details:
  TestName: setMusicIdWithMaxValue
  Description: Evaluates the behavior of the setMusicId method when provided with the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Music object and define musicId as Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Call setMusicId with Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Assert that the MusicId field is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test checks that maximum integer values are correctly managed by the setter method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Proper handling of maximum values is essential to ensure that the application behaves predictably under all conditions.
Scenario 4: Setting a music ID with a zero value
Details:
  TestName: setMusicIdWithZero
  Description: Tests whether the setMusicId method can correctly assign a zero value to the MusicId field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Music object and set musicId to 0.
  Act: Call setMusicId with the value 0.
  Assert: Assert that the MusicId field is set to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test ensures that zero values, which might be used as default or placeholder values, are correctly assigned.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Handling zero values correctly is important, especially in scenarios where a zero might represent an uninitialized or default state.
