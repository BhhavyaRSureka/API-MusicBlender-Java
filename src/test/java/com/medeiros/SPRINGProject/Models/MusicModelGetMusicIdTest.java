### Test Scenarios for `getMusicId` Method
---
**Scenario 1: Default MusicId Test**
Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultMusicId
  Description: This test checks the default value of MusicId when a new instance of the class is created and no value has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `getMusicId` method.
  Act: Call the `getMusicId` method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the default value for an uninitialized int (0 in Java).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the MusicId field is initialized to Java's default for int types, which is 0. This is crucial to ensure that uninitialized MusicId fields do not yield unexpected behavior or values.
---
**Scenario 2: Set and Retrieve MusicId**
Details:
  TestName: verifyMusicIdAfterSetting
  Description: This test checks if the MusicId can be retrieved correctly after being set to a specific value via a hypothetical setter method (if setter is available, otherwise, through reflection or constructor if constructor injection is used).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the MusicId to a specific value (e.g., 1234).
  Act: Retrieve the MusicId by invoking the `getMusicId` method.
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved MusicId matches the value set (1234 in this case).
Validation:
  This test validates that the MusicId field holds and returns the correct value that was set. It ensures the integrity of the MusicId value throughout the object lifecycle, which is vital for accurate identification and processing of music entity instances.
---
**Scenario 3: MusicId Consistency Across Multiple Calls**
Details:
  TestName: verifyMusicIdConsistency
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to `getMusicId` return consistent results, assuming no changes are made to the MusicId in between calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the MusicId to a known value (e.g., 5678).
  Act: Call `getMusicId` multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same value (5678 in this case).
Validation:
  The assertion checks for consistency in the returned values of MusicId across multiple method calls. This consistency is critical for reliability, ensuring that the MusicId is stored and retrieved correctly without unintended modifications.
---
**Scenario 4: MusicId with Maximum Integer Value**
Details:
  TestName: verifyMusicIdWithMaxIntValue
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `getMusicId` method when the MusicId is set to Java's maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the MusicId to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
  Act: Retrieve the MusicId by invoking the `getMusicId` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned MusicId is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
Validation:
  The test verifies that `getMusicId` handles and returns the maximum possible integer value correctly. This test is significant to ensure that the system can handle edge cases regarding integer limits.
---
These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases that help ensure the `getMusicId` method functions correctly in various situations, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
