 **Scenario 1: Valid Like Count**

**TestName**: rithmPointsByLike_ValidCount

**Description**: This test aims to verify that the rithmPointsByLike method correctly calculates the rithm points based on a valid like count.

**Execution**:
- Arrange: Create an instance of algorithmData and initialize it with a valid like count, for example 100.
- Act: Call the rithmPointsByLike method with the valid like count.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned rithm points are equal to the expected value, which is 1000 (100 likes * 10 points per like).

**Validation**: This test ensures that the rithmPointsByLike method correctly rewards users with rithm points when they receive likes on their content. It validates that the calculation is done accurately based on the specified rule of 10 points per like.

**Significance**: This test is crucial for ensuring that users are properly rewarded and incentivized for their contributions to the platform, thus promoting user engagement and content creation.

**Scenario 2: Zero Like Count**

**TestName**: rithmPointsByLike_ZeroCount

**Description**: This test checks whether the rithmPointsByLike method returns 0 when the like count is 0.

**Execution**:
- Arrange: Create an instance of algorithmData and initialize it with a like count of 0.
- Act: Call the rithmPointsByLike method with the zero like count.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned rithm points are equal to 0.

**Validation**: This test confirms that the rithmPointsByLike method correctly handles cases where there are no likes, ensuring that users do not receive undeserved rithm points.

**Significance**: This test ensures fairness and accuracy in the allocation of rithm points, preventing users from exploiting the system by artificially inflating their like counts.

---

**Scenario 3: Negative Like Count**

**TestName**: rithmPointsByLike_NegativeCount

**Description**: This test verifies that the rithmPointsByLike method throws an IllegalArgumentException when the like count is negative.

**Execution**:
- Arrange: Create an instance of algorithmData and initialize it with a negative like count, for example -10.
- Act: Attempt to call the rithmPointsByLike method with the negative like count.
- Assert: Use JUnit's expected exception feature to verify that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

**Validation**: This test ensures that the rithmPointsByLike method handles invalid input correctly by throwing an appropriate exception.

**Significance**: This test safeguards the system from unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities caused by invalid input values.

---

**Scenario 4: Maximum Integer Value**

**TestName**: rithmPointsByLike_MaxValue

**Description**: This test checks whether the rithmPointsByLike method can correctly handle the maximum integer value (Integer.MAX_VALUE) as the like count.

**Execution**:
- Arrange: Create an instance of algorithmData and initialize it with the maximum integer value as the like count.
- Act: Call the rithmPointsByLike method with the maximum integer value.
- Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned rithm points are equal to the expected value, which is Integer.MAX_VALUE * 10 (the maximum possible rithm points).

**Validation**: This test ensures that the rithmPointsByLike method does not overflow or encounter any numerical issues when dealing with extremely large like counts.

**Significance**: This test guarantees the stability and accuracy of the system even in exceptional scenarios with exceptionally high like counts.
